Cryptocurrency refers to digitally secured assets using cryptographic techniques. These digital assets are typically built on a distributed ledger technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a database where transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable.

Cryptocurrencies enable a decentralized, anonymous, and secure payment system without the need for a central authority. Pioneering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin emerged as alternatives to traditional financial systems. However, risks such as market fluctuations, security concerns, and regulatory uncertainties exist.

The adoption of cryptocurrencies has the potential to revolutionize financial technology, but ongoing research and regulatory efforts are rapidly increasing in this field.
